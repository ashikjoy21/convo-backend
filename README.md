## Project Description

The **AI-Driven English Communication Platform** is a cutting-edge application that leverages artificial intelligence to help users improve their English language skills. By engaging in real-time conversations with an AI, users can enhance their fluency, pronunciation, and grammar while receiving personalized feedback and progress insights. 

Key features include:
- **Speech-to-Text Transcription**: Converts spoken language into text using Whisper models.
- **Text-to-Speech Audio Responses**: Generates clear, natural-sounding AI responses with TTS models.
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: Utilizes memory management to provide relevant and personalized interactions.
- **User Progress Tracking**: Offers feedback on language use and highlights areas for improvement.

Built with a robust tech stack including Python (Flask), Supabase, AWS, and GPU-optimized AI tools, this platform is designed for scalability, efficiency, and user engagement. It aims to make language learning accessible, interactive, and effective for users worldwide.

## Features

### 1. **Real-time AI-Driven Conversations**
- Engage in natural conversations with an AI that adapts to the user's goals and preferences.
- Context-aware responses based on personalized memory management.

### 2. **Speech-to-Text (STT)**
- Uses **faster-whisper** library for high-quality audio transcription.
- Supports English transcription with low latency.

### 3. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**
- Leverages **TTS models** (`tts_models/en/ljspeech/vits`) for clear and natural-sounding audio responses.
- Audio streaming for real-time interaction.

### 4. **User Memory Management**
- Extracts and saves user-specific data like preferences, goals, and events for personalized responses.
- Retrieves and integrates relevant memories into ongoing conversations.

### 5. **Conversation History**
- Stores chat history in **Supabase** to provide context-aware responses.
- Summarizes conversations to highlight key insights and areas for improvement.

### 6. **Feedback Mechanisms**
- Provides constructive feedback on pronunciation, vocabulary, and language use.
- Summarizes user progress at the end of each session.

### 7. **User Authentication and Security**
- Implements JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
- API key management for secure access to app functionalities.

### 8. **Cloud Integration**
- Hosted on **AWS** for scalability and reliability.
- Uses **Supabase** for database operations and user authentication.

   cd convo-backend
   ```
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Supabase:
   - Create a Supabase project and configure the database.
   - Update the environment variables in `.env` with your Supabase credentials.

4. Run the backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
5. (Optional) Set up the frontend:
   - Navigate to the `frontend` directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
